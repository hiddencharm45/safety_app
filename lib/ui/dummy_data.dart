          '''In India Sati, Sabitri, Durga, Laxmi are worshipped by people treating them as goddesses where as there is increasing number of violence against women. The amount of violence against women has increased by many fold due to the greater exposure of women in every field of life. Women were previously restricted to the four walls of the houses and after globalisation they have got the chances and opportunities to stand equally in all sectors at par with male. Women are now a days cab drivers and they are also the CEO of top companies.

It is a good sign that the patriarchal mind set of the society has changed to some extent but not to the extent it was supposed to. It is the same mind set that restricts women to go out and work making them as a tool for domestication. It is the same mind set that treats males as superior than female and always try to dominate the women folk.

There are different kinds of tools that is being used by the male dominated society to prove their domination over the female. Eve teasing, sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence against women are these weapons used by the male to display the male superiority. This is one of the prime reason violence is increasing in India and women safety is a concern in India.

Along with the mind set the slow pace of operation of Indian judiciary is another major reason for the increasing women safety in India. The police of India is not efficient and not neutral and that is the reason why the cases of violence against women takes long time in the investigation phase. In the name of social pressure and shame many women did not come out and report the matter to police. This is one of the many reasons why the number of cases reported are less than the actual number of violence happening against women.

It is a shame that rapes take place everyday. Rape is a disease which attacks from everywhere to everywhere. It is an evil that has no boundaries. It is present in every nook and corner of the world. It doesn’t differentiate between a 3-year-old kid and an 80-year-old lady. From parties to workplaces to our homes, rape and harassment have become a norm. The survivors of these heinous crimes are then left to be humiliated throughout their life. Some of them even spend their whole “after rape life” on ventilators or they are burnt alive.

In order to improve women safety in India the first task is to improve the number of women in every sphere of society. Along with that the change in mind set of people is very essential for the safety of women. From family to educational institutions men should be taught about respecting females. Further, there should be fast-track courts to hear the cases and they cases should be investigated in a time bound manner. Only strict laws can not solve the problem of women safety in India rather the implementation of these laws in a time bound manner can solve the issue to a large extent.

That's why the understanding of Women Safety and A will to work together for better cause is our App's goal.. '''),

      description: '''1.Police Reforms and Support :

Large scale impactful training, robust standard operating procedures for filing FIR, investigation, and charge-sheet, and above all it should be time-bound. This needs strong enforcement amongst the police force. Increasing women’s police force to levels of 30% merits considering. We all know effective police patrolling  with speedy response delivers confidence for women’s safety

2.Speedy Justice:

The fast tracks courts exist only in name, often not in place or not functioning. We need resources and oversight to ensure Fast Track Courts are functioning as planned across the states and country. Gender sensitization of judicial authorities, if required merits training

3.Special Investigation Units:

For heinous crimes to expedite the investigation process should be ensured.

4.Capacity training of Prosecutors:

Bails are easily granted without much well-supported arguments by Prosecutors. We need a strong process to ensure evidence, information, and documentation by police are submitted so that bail is not easily granted in violent crimes. Often the perpetrators on bail end up threatening victim and their families leading to serious consequences.

5.POSH & POCSO :

Implementation of these laws in its letter and spirit and consequences for not implementing these laws should be strongly penalized

In the medium term, we need infrastructural and policy changes as follows:

1.Infrastructure to ensure the safety of women in public spaces: 

Street Lights, bus stands, pavements, waiting rooms, public toilets, public transport which are GPS enabled, CCTV. etc. should be safe for women. In addition, The One Stop Centres and Local Complaints Committee (LCC) should be effectively functioning in every single district. This infrastructure will deliver a level of much-needed confidence for women’s safety.

2. 24/7 Helpline and Safety Apps with speedy response:

GPS enabled and tracked for effectiveness. 

3.Promote Women’s safety awareness and empowerment:

Sustained multi-year programs may include self-defense, leadership skills, educating on law and legal options about women’s safety and empowerment is essential. This has to be an ongoing agenda. Communication with men is equally important for women’s safety. We need to communicate on both gender equality and sensitivity in all the campaigns and communications, across urban & rural, sectors. Women need to be perceived as strong and equal.

4.Nirbhaya Fund:

States must use this fund fully and optimally to enable both infrastructure needs for women’s safety and capacity building on gender sensitivity and equality. Currently, it’s grossly underutilized.

5.Dedicated Position in the Ministry of Women & Child:

whose priority should be data-driven, solution led a review of progress on crimes against women and children. Currently, Women and Child Development (WCD) has many responsibilities, and further given law and order is state subject, the gravity of the issue of crimes against women and children does not appear to be strongly addressed in our overall system. A singular and sustained multi-year focus by Senior Government officials will enable a more streamlined and effective implementation of the process to tackle crimes against women and children. This will be a major confidence-building measure for women’s safety much like Swacch Bharat we need Suraksha Bharat

      title: 'Self Defence Tips',

      description: '''💪🏼 Hammer strike
Using your car keys is one of the easiest ways to defend yourself. Don’t use your fingernails, because you’re more at risk to injure your hands.

Instead, if you feel unsafe while walking at night, have your keys stick out from one side of your fist for hammer strikes.
Another way to use your keys is to click them onto a lanyard to swing at your attacker.

To perform:

Hold your key ring in a tight fist, like holding a hammer, with keys extending from the side of your hand.
Thrust downward toward your target.

💪🏼 Groin kick
If someone is coming at you from the front, a groin kick may deliver enough force to paralyze your attacker, making your escape possible.

To perform:

Stabilize yourself as best you can.
Lift your dominant leg off the ground and begin to drive your knee upward.
Extend your dominant leg, drive hips forward, slightly lean back, and kick forcefully, making contact between your lower shin or ball of your foot and the attacker’s groin area.
Alternative: If your attacker is too close, thrust your knee toward the groin. Make sure you’re stabilized and not at risk of falling over.

💪🏼 Heel palm strike
This move can cause damage to the nose or throat. To execute, get in front of your attacker as much as is possible.

To perform:

With your dominant hand, flex your wrist.
Aim for either the attacker’s nose, jabbing upward from the nostrils, or underneath the attacker’s chin, jabbing upward at the throat.
Make sure to recoil your strike. Pulling your arm back quickly will help thrust the attacker’s head up and back.
This will cause your attacker to stagger backward, allowing you to escape their grasp.
Alternative: An open palm to the ears can be very disorienting.

💪🏼 Elbow strike
If your attacker is in close range and you’re unable to get enough momentum to throw a strong punch or kick, use your elbows

To perform:

If you can, stabilize yourself with a strong core and legs to ensure a powerful blow.
Bend your arm at the elbow, shift your weight forward, and strike your elbow into your attacker’s neck, jawline, chin, or temple. These are all effective targets.
This may cause your attacker to loosen their grip, allowing you to run.

💪🏼 Alternative elbow strikes
Depending on how you’re standing when you’re initially attacked, you may be in a better position for variations on the elbow strike.

To perform from the front:

Lift your elbow to shoulder height.
Pivot on same-side foot and allow your hips to rotate, creating more momentum into the front part of your elbow when you strike.

To perform from the side and back:

Make sure you see the target.
Bring your elbow up and pivot your opposite foot, rotating your hips and turning into the target, making contact with the back part of your elbow.

💪🏼 Escape from a ‘bear hug attack’
For cases where the attacker is coming from behind, you’ll want to use this move. Focus on getting low and creating space to free yourself.

To perform:

Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight forward, making it more difficult for your attacker to pick you up. It also gives you a better angle to throw elbows from side to side to the attacker’s face.
Turn into the attacker with one of your elbows and continue counterattacking.
This should give you space to turn fully, using another move to injure the face or strike the groin. With the space these moves have created, you may be able to escape and run away.

💪🏼 Escape with hands trapped
If your attacker comes from behind and traps your arms (this is similar to a bear hug, but you won’t be able to move as freely), here’s what to do:

First reaction should be to stop your attacker’s arms from going higher into a headlock. Shift your hips to one side. This gives an opening for strikes to the groin with open-handed slaps.
Bring your hand back up to your arms and raise your opposite elbow to turn into the wrap. Keep your arms tight to your chest as you’re turning in.
Stay aggressive with your knees and other counterattacks until you can disengage.

💪🏼 Escape from side headlock
When the attacker locks their arm around your head from the side, your first instinct should be to avoid getting choked.

To perform:

Turn into the attacker’s side as much as possible to avoid being choked.
With your hand that’s furthest away, strike the groin with open-handed slaps until you have enough mobility to turn your head all the way out to disengage.

How to stay safe if you aren’t physically able to protect yourself
However, if you don’t feel confident you’re able to physically handle an attacker, take these precautions:

If you’re carrying self-defense tools, make sure to get training on how to use them. You can also use more common objects as weapons, including a purse, briefcase, umbrella, phone, pencil, book, or rock.

Anything blunt that can be used to hit, throw, stab, or swing can be very effective.

Learn to develop boundaries, even with people you know
The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network reports that 70 percent of sexual violence cases aren’t committed by random strangers in a dark alley, but by people we know: friends, family, partners, co-workers, etc.

This can cause us to let our guard down. We might be too embarrassed, too shy, or too scared to hurt others’ feelings that we don’t always think about ourselves.

Some essential principles of prevention also include:

Awareness. Make sure you’re aware of your environment as much as possible. Limit distractions when walking from place to place or other public settings. Don’t constantly stare down at your phone. Make sure you can hear around you. Have keys ready. Walk with a purpose.
Boundaries. Make it a point to ask yourself why somebody makes you uncomfortable. Be verbal with them. No matter how much you want a friendship or relationship to work, if they can’t respect your boundaries, they’re somebody you shouldn’t have in your life.

Where or how to get practice
Whether someone is coming at you from the front, side, or back, basic self-defense knowledge can put you in a spot to properly defend yourself.

If Krav Maga or muay thai classes are offered in your area, consider signing up. Muay thai is a combat sport in Thailand that uses stand-up striking techniques. Krav Maga is a modern self-defense system.

If you want to build strength in a high-intensity situation and learn self-defense moves, check out your local kickboxing or any other martial arts courses, like karate.

When equipped with some basic self-defense knowledge, women young or old, city dwellers or country residents, can have confidence in their personal safety and protection. No matter what type of combat or self-defense class you take, practicing can help you develop muscle memory. In a flight-or-flight situation, this muscle memory can be key to helping you escape from an attacker.

          '''Crimes against women occur every minute in India. Women are not safe, whether it is in their houses, public places or at the workplace. Your safety in your hands sounds like a clichéd adage to repeat. Given the number of crimes that are committed against women, it is pertinent that women are aware about the laws that are in place to protect them.

Remember knowledge is power. As a parent, wife, daughter, employee and a woman these are rights set in place to protect you and it is important that you are aware about these.

Here are 10 laws that women should know:

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006

According to the International Research Centre for Women, almost 47 percent of girls are married before the age of 18. Currently, India ranks 13 in the world when it comes to child marriages. Since child marriage has been steeped into the Indian culture and tradition since centuries, it has been tough eliminating it.

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child marriage as a marriage where the groom or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years.

Parents trying to marry underage girls are subject to action under this law. Since the law makes these marriages illegal, it acts as a major deterrent.

Special Marriage Act, 1954

The objectives of this act is to provide – a special form of marriage in certain cases, provide for registration of certain marriages and, to provide for divorce. In a country like India and with the diverse religions and cast, when people from different faiths and caste chose to get married they do it under the Special Marriage Act.

It is not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and also extends to intending spouses who are Indian nationals and living abroad.

Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961

According to this act, taking or giving of dowry at the time of the marriage to the bride or the bridegroom and their family is to be penalised. Dowry system, giving and taking of dowry, is a norm in India. Dowry is often asked of the bride and her family by the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women after marriage move in with their spouse and in-laws. Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic independence of women and the taboo towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. When demands for dowry even after marriage are not met by the girl’s families, many women are tortured, beaten and even burnt.

It is one of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly complaining about it has helped to spread the word and encourage other women to take a stand.

Indian Divorce Act, 1969

The Indian Divorce Act allows the dissolution of marriage, mutual consent, nullity of marriage, judicial separation and restitution of conjugal rights.

Family Courts are established to file, hear, and dispose of such cases.

Maternity Benefit Act,1861

This act regulates the employment of women and maternity benefits mandated by law. It states that a woman employee who has worked in an organisation for a period of at least 80 days during the 12 months preceding the date of her expected delivery is entitled to receive maternity benefits, which includes maternity leave, nursing breaks, medical allowance, etc.

Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act,1971

The Act came into effect into 1972, was amended in 1975 and 2002. The aim of the Act is to reduce the occurrence of illegal abortion and consequent maternal mortality and morbidity.

It clearly states the conditions under which a pregnancy can be ended or aborted and specifies the persons qualified to conduct the same.

Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013

To ensure women’s safety at workplace, this Act seeks to protect them from sexual harassment at their place of work. Thirty-six percent of Indian companies and 25 percent among MNC’s are not complaint with the Sexual Harassment Act according to a FICCI-EY November 2015 report.

Sexual harassment at workplace also includes – the use of language with sexual overtones, invasion of private space with a male colleague hovering too close for comfort, subtle touches and innuendoes.

Indecent Representation of Women(Prevention) Act,1986

This Act prohibits indecent representation of women through advertisement or in publications, writings, paintings, figures or in any other manner.

National Commission for Women Act, 1990

The National Commission for Women (NCW) is a statutory body of the Government of India, established in January 1992. Lalitha Kumaramangalam was appointed its Chairperson in 2014.

The NCW represents the rights of women in India and provides a voice for their issues and concerns. The National Commission for Women Act aims to improve the status of women and worked for their economic empowerment.

Equal Remuneration Act, 1976

This Act prevents discrimination in terms of remuneration. It provides for payment of equal recompense to men and women workers.

It is necessary to know these and other laws in place to protect the interests of women. Only if you are aware of your rights can you fight against any injustice meted out to you at home, at the workplace, or in the society.
